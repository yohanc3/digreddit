    "body": "The Kauai Humane Society has a wonderful program where you can take a shelter dog out for the day on a ‚Äúfield trip.‚Äù They give you everything you need (water, bowl, poop bags, toys, towel and treats) and set you up with a dog that matches your activities for the day. \n\nThis is Princess. I‚Äôve taken her on 3 field trips - once in February and twice during my visit last week. She is an absolute sweetheart. Shes a total cuddle bug, gives the sloppiest kisses and loves adventure. She was great in the car and I had no issues taking care of her by myself. I wish could adopt her but I live in a high rise with a cat and a dog. Yes, you can set up an adoption to the mainland. They set up everything and it‚Äôs a very easy and smooth process. So I hope that someone falls in love with her as much as I did and gives her a loving home that she deserves. Or, at the very least, takes her or one of her friends on a field trip! ",

    "author": "Relative-Gain4192",
    "body": "Something funny I noticed about the size 2 thing: no matter how large the fish is, it‚Äôs still size 1. Even Leviathan is confirmed to be size 1 by Hakita himself. However, it has never been directly stated that size 2 is bigger than size 1. So, what if that means that size 2 is smaller than size 1?\n\nAnd this bring me to the main point: I think that the V2 margarita is the size 2 fish.\n\nV2 in the margarita is noticeably smaller than V2 in any of its other appearances. Also, in the dev museum, Mandalore says that we‚Äôd find size 2 in the place where we find the V2 margarita. \n\nAnother thing, when you punch the margarita, it breaks and you can‚Äôt pick it up, therefore you can never collect it. On the leaderboards of 5-S, it says that Hakita and Pitr are the only 2 who have ever gotten size 2, who are the 2 main developers of the game, and therefore *would have had to pick up the margarita so they could put it there.* They‚Äôre the only ones who have size 2 *because they‚Äôre the only ones who can have it.*\n\nBut my last piece of evidence is my most stupid. Tell, me, what is the message left on the beach that ‚ÄúSize 2‚Äù left there? It says ‚ÄúSorry, gone fishin‚Äô!‚Äù And what‚Äôs the last weapon we get from V2 before we kill him? That‚Äôs right, the Whiplash, a *hook and a line that can pull things toward the user.* V2 was using the Whiplash to fish! Probably to get blood to heal its wounds, and then chase after V1! In V2‚Äôs second entry, it says that it constructed the Whiplash to help it give chase to V1, but we never see V2 use it to fight you, and it doesn‚Äôt really make you able to go places faster unless there‚Äôs hookpoints. So how would it speed up the process? This is the answer: it expedited the process of catching fish so that V2 could collect blood faster, and be able to chase after V1 sooner.\n\nI rest my case.",

    "body": "(WARNING SELF HARM) \nI 23m no longer want to live. I felt like this for years 13 years to be exact might be even longer actually now that I think about it I had a rough growing up. I always felt neglected and unloved. I took that pain and harbor it for years I wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak to anyone about it anytime I told my family about self harm or how bad my feelings were hurt hurting I was told to keep it to myself or that men aren‚Äôt supposed to feel this way, but I wasn‚Äôt a man I was a child. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to see a therapist but they were belittled for me for that they said only crazy and sick people need to go see therapist I wasn‚Äôt crazier sick. I was just young. That‚Äôs what they told me and I believed it and because of that I kept growing up, thinking that I needed to hide my emotions because that‚Äôs not what a man would do. A man doesn‚Äôt speak about his emotions he supposed to bottle it up and let the woman be the one that is emotional, and I lived by that ideology for years. I broke my girlfriend‚Äòs heart. I kept my emotions to myself, which made me act weird I wasn‚Äôt telling her everything because I was afraid that she‚Äôd reject me or I get the same treatment that I‚Äôve been dealing with my whole life, but she was nothing like that, and I took that for granted because I never saw that I was so convinced that I was always in the wrong that giving her my 100% full self and not being the man that my family thought I would be I thought she would leave me because of it, but it turns out she left due to the fact that I could not open up to her in time to give my side of the story and why I acted the way I did she always knew I was broken, but I thought that she never saw those parts of me. I thought I was doing a good job hiding it and I broke her and every day that I realize that I‚Äôm in this home alone this silence is getting so loud I just want it all to stop my head hurts. I haven‚Äôt stopped crying in over a week. My head hurts. I‚Äôm weak. I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve got no motivation. I lost interest in all my hobbies haven‚Äôt smiled in weeks. I‚Äôm not even hungry. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I ate. I‚Äôm hoping that maybe I can just go from starvation or something I spoke to the hotline. It was honestly useless. I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever sounded so uninterested. I never balled my eyes out before in front of a stranger, and this woman sounded like my problems were minimal It only reopened that fear that my emotions aren‚Äôt relevant so I lay here contemplating what to do next. I don‚Äôt want a painful death. I just want it to be seamless. I‚Äôd like to go in my sleep or something. i‚Äôm sorry this is all over the place. I‚Äôm just using text to speech. I‚Äôm trying to form all my thoughts there‚Äôs a lot to this this break up isn‚Äôt why I‚Äôm suicidal, but it is a catalyst in a long, long history of pain rejection, and abandonment that I‚Äôve been dealing with my father walked out on me multiple times my mother was barely there. My grandmother was always angry. my grandfather lived in a different country so a lot of the time when I needed to get all this emotion out it was always just me and I never learned how to cope. I just kept pushing forward because I thought that‚Äôs what my heroes would do but even they had bad days and sometimes they never recovered and I think I‚Äôm just in that point of not being able to see over the hurdle, I just want out. It‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been thinking about. It‚Äôd be so freeing. so far I avoided cutting myself because I‚Äôm hoping that somehow I‚Äôll find a glimmer of light that‚Äôll make me wanna keep going and I‚Äôd hate to have my family or her see those kinda scars but so far it‚Äôs been pretty bleak. I haven‚Äôt left my house. I‚Äôve got no motivation too. Nothing feels correct anymore. I hate the person I become. I wish I wasn‚Äôt scared to talk about my emotions. This post is a big leap for me or at least it‚Äôll be a little piece of history that I existed.",

    "author": "ShiroUntold",
    "body": "I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+\n\nKinks (All of Which are Optional and I can gladly include some of yours): bad end, hero to villain, Cuckold/Cuckquean/NTR/Cheating, Mind Break, Instant Loss, breeding, transformation, bimbofication, IQ Loss, impregnation, bdsm, romance, wholesome, aftercare, Cuddling, kisses, public affection, fussing (each of us doing it on separate occasions), praise, cock worship and praise, outfit control of one another or just one of us, blackmail, revenge, and many more I can't think of right now.\n\nPlot Ideas: I have 3, but can always create more or edit my current ones to fit your tastes.\n\n#1. Fantasy. Cuckold/Cheating. Milder Bad End\n\n(Can be done with you playing only one or multiple Ladies) Perhaps I‚Äôm a noble or a new member of the local adventurer‚Äôs guild. A mostly female group along with their one male member are forced to interact with me. Whether through me bullying the loser of their party or a mission they need my help with, they are made to interact. Perhaps I invite them to challenge me if they want me to stop bullying their male member, or I refuse to help them unless they agree to help me out with something.\n\nWhatever the case, perhaps I use a special magic to rewrite their minds, instantly defeating them and rendering them submissive and helpless before me. Maybe I do beat them down and forcefully rearrange their minds into a proper serviceable form. Whatever the case, turning the party against the original pathetic cuckold and turning them into my personal fuckdolls to use however I want\n\n#2. Fantasy. Potential Cuckold/Cheating. Much darker Bad End\n\n(Can be done with you playing only one or multiple Ladies) You‚Äôve been sent to stop the evil king. His reign of terror has spread across the land, and he needs to be defeated before it‚Äôs too late. So, adventurers come to his dark palace and they attack. Perhaps at first they seem successful. Killing minions and monsters alike. It seems like they can do this! But unfortunately‚Ä¶ It was a trap. They confidently move forward and suddenly the floor falls out. They‚Äôre brought one by one into dark rooms where they are unable to contact the rest of their parties. And they‚Äôre defeated all alone.\n\nBut that‚Äôs not the worst part. With them defeated, the male members of the party have been executed. The women are the Evil King‚Äôs newest cocksleeves, being fucked and broken into being loyal little fucksluts. But they become the generals of his army. The heroes, who once inspired hope and happiness, are now slaughtering the men to bring women back to the Evil King and his army to add to their ranks. Snd no one can stop them, as the strongest warriors they had are now the very ones who are destroying them.\n\n#3 Sci-Fi. Potential Cuckold/Cheating. Darker Bad End\n\n(Can be done with you playing only one or multiple Ladies) In New Las Vegas, the world is bright for those who have money. They‚Äôre treated like kings and queens. However, there is a seedy underbelly. The best casino in town also has robotic prostitutes who feel extra realistic! Imagine that! What they don‚Äôt know is that women are lured in through free chips. They are given 1,000 Dollars worth of chips they can only use to Gamble. They‚Äôre given good food and alcohol. And when they‚Äôre in a weakened state, they begin losing. Over. And over. And over again. They lose until they owe the Casino hundreds.\n\nThen the owner ‚Äúgenerously‚Äù has the woman‚Äôs debt forgiven if they can test new cybernetics on her. Replacing an arm or a leg. But if they can win it back, they‚Äôre fix her! And they just lose. And lose. And lose. Soon, they‚Äôve replaced everything except her head and torso. The woman‚Äôs body is then used to make a sufficient Android who will work for them as a Prostitute. And the women can still earn money back to try and gamble! Or, of course, she could also serve. Those who do have a chip implanted in their head and they never leave. Them and their Android Doppelg√§nger becoming good cockwhores for the Casino. Although the Owner keeps his favorites to personally serve him.",
