It continuously ingests every post and comment across Reddit, using smart keyword matching and semantic analysis to surface conversations relevant to your product or service. Just provide a short description of what you offer, and the tool automatically identifies Reddit threads where people are likely expressing interest, pain points, or buying intent related to your niche. No manual browsing, no guesswork â€” just actionable leads as they happen.'
